I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, with a deep passion for advancing the field of machine learning. My research is focused on addressing challenging problems related to fairness, operating under limited data, and ensuring trustworthiness in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and multi-modal systems. My goal is to make meaningful contributions to these fields through rigorous research and practical application.
## Research Interest
### Machine Learning Under Limited Data
- Self-supervised Learning
- Positive-Unlabeled Learning
- Novel Category Discovery
  
### Trustworthy AI
- Fairness and Debiasing in Machine Learning
- Multi-Modal Fairness in Foundational Models


## Applied Engineering
- I have developed generative models for multi-band planar antennas and created explainable models for electromagnetic simulations.
- Work Experience: My experience spans both research and applied engineering, including the optimization of refrigeration systems at Samsung Electronics and serving as an Aircraft Maintenance Officer in the ROK Air Force.

## Teaching Experience
- I have taught courses in Python programming and data analytics, demonstrating my commitment to education and sharing knowledge.
